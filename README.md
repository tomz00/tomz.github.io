# About

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which I might use in the future. Another goal is to get myself familiar with Git.

## Access

The website with the source code in this repo is publicly available with GitHub Pages and its domain on https://tomz00.github.io/. However, I mapped DNS records to be able to access my website with my own https://tomz.sk/ domain.
